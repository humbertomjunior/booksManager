VALUES ('War & Peace', 'War and Peace is a vast epic centred on Napoleons war with Russia. While it expresses Tolstoys view that history is an inexorable process which man cannot influence, he peoples his great novel with a cast of over five hundred characters. Three of these, the artless and delightful Natasha Rostov, the world-weary Prince Andrew Bolkonsky and the idealistic Pierre Bezukhov illustrate Tolstoys philosophy in this novel of unquestioned mastery. This translation is one which received Tolstoys approval.', 'Romance', 'Leo Nikolayevich Tolstoy', 'Wordsworth Editions', '1867', '1', 1024, '9781853260629');
